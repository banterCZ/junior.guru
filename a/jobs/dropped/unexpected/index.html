        <textarea rows="20" cols="100">&lt;p&gt;Build the infrastructure that powers better access to banking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prelim is how banks onboard their customers for business checking accounts, personal loans, etc online. Banks are stuck in the past with bad online customer experiences that result in real people losing out. We&#39;re fixing a broken system, and with that comes lots of fun challenges, security, isolation, scaling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;salary-and-compensation&#34;&gt;Salary and compensation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Engineer, Developer and Digital Nomad jobs that are similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$60,000 ‚Äî $120,000/year&lt;/p&gt;
