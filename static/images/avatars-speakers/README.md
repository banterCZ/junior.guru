# Speakers

Profile pictures of speakers from `events.yml`. They should have square dimensions. The stem of the file name should be the same as their Discord user ID.

You can drop large files here and they'll be automatically edited during `poetry run invoke sync.events`, but be sure to run that before commit and push.
